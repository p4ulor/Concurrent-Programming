     If a tryEnqueue() call comes with too many messages, they will all wait.
     I didn't chose to add message by message until (and if) the maximum capacity is reached, to simplify and because
     the timeout is supposed to regard the whole list, not parts of it. If I did it like that, it would be possible
     that certain messages would be enqueued, the max capacity if reached, and then timeout reaches zero, part of the
     messages were not enqueued and plus the method returns Boolean, not the list of messages that didn't go through
