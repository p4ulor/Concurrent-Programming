_Package_ para os testes da primeira série de exercícios.

Note: asserts() should only be called inside the @Test functions, otherwise the green checkmark icon can be displayed, 
when in fact an assert inside the Utils class could have failed...

Also, the asserts() should be in separate lines, so that when it fails, and we inspect the console, 
when we click on the line, it's clear what check failed

I try to cut down on lines with repetitive instructions/patterns
